            Hello! I am Onyx, a female kitten born on August 6, 2017. I was adopted from the street along with my brother when we were around two weeks old. We lost our parents for an unknown reason very early, so we had to be fed by some weird bottle with rubber. Once we arived at our new home we were greeted by a huge animal (we later learned it was a dog). The first days were hard, but now we have started living outside and we play and fight all day (and sleep a lot too!). I recently created <a href="https://instagram.com/theonyxkitten" target="_blank">a new Instagram account</a> since it came to my attention that that is the new way for cats and kittens to socialize. Of course, we were invaded by humans, but we will soon take over instagram again.
